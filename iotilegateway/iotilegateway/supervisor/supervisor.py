    The supervisor runs in separate thread in a tornado IOLoop and you can call the synchronous
    wait function to wait for it to quit.  It will loop forever unless you stop it by calling
    the stop() or stop_from_signal() methods.  These functions add a task to the gateway's
    event loop and implicitly call wait to synchronously wait until the gateway loop actually
    stops.

            expected_services (list): An optional list of services that you expect to be running
                on this device so that their status can be prepopulated.  Each service entry should
                be a dict with two keys:
                    short_name (str): A unique short name for the service
