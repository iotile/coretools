### START OF ARCH PR GUIDE -- DELETE THIS SECTION BEFORE OPENING PR


Please familiarize yourself with the [Contributing](https://github.com/iotile/coretools/blob/feat-better-guides/CONTRIBUTING.md#generic-pull-request-process) guide BEFORE submitting a PR.

Here's a summarized TL;DR -

1. Pass tests and validate style (linting) as you develop
2. Write new tests for new functions. Improve old tests!
3. Keep your PR small. Separate it by issue if you need to.
4. Update RELEASE.md notes
5. Be as descriptive as possible in the PR description.
6. Use git tools to manage review flow (resolve comments, re-request)
7. Clean up commits and merge

We will start closing PRs that skip steps and asking them to be resubmitted properly.
