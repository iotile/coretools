class ConnectionManager(threading.Thread):
    """A class that manages connection states and transitions.

    ConnectionManager presents a nonblocking interface that is designed
    to work with DeviceAdapter.  It handles maintaining an internal dictionary
    of currently active connections and a worker thread that processes
    requested changes to those connections.  All work is synchronized
    through requests to the worker thread.

    A connection can be in one of 4 macrostates:
        disconnected: There is no connection
        connecting: The connection has been started but has not yet entered
            a fully connected state
        idle: The connection is connected and idle
        in_progress: An operation is in progress on the connection
        disconnecting: The connection has started the disconnect process
        but has not finished it yet.

    The user of ConnectionManager is free to create their own microstates if
    the actions required to, e.g., connect to a device require a sequence
    of actions.

    Each connection has a user managed context associated with it that can be used
    to track data about the connection and an internal identifier that can be used
    to retrieve a connection's user context along with an integer connection_id.

    ConnectionManager just enforces that state transitions only happen in
    the following ways:
        nonexistent -> connecting -> idle <--> in_progress <--> idle -> disconnecting -> nonexistant

    ConnectionManager will fail a request that does not follow the above pattern.
