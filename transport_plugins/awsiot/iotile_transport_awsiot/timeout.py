    You can check if the timeout is expired by using the expired
    property.  This class attempts to work around issues on devices
    whose time may not be properly synchronized by looking for
    large jumps backwards in time and resetting the interval.

    The net result is that you will have a TimeoutInterval that
    does not go forever when someone sets the time into the past
    but also may not be exactly the interval you set.

        timeout (float): The number of seconds from now that the
