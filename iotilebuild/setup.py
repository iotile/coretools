# Caveats and possible issues
# Mac OS X
# - when using a virtualenv, readline is not properly installed into the virtualenv
#   and cannot be imported.  You need to install it using easy_install as described here
#   http://calvinx.com/tag/readline/
#
# NB There is a required manual post-install step to register iotilebuild with the iotile command
# so that you can use the iotile build command.  Run
# > iotile registry add_plugin build iotilebuild.build.build,build
