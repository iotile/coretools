# Release Notes

All major changes in each released version of iotile-sensorgraph are listed here.

## HEAD

- Move reference controller and reference device classes out of iotile-sensorgraph
  and into new iotile-emulate package.

## 0.7.2

- Add support for broadcast streamers that indicate to the receiving tile that
  it should broadcast the streamed data rather than packaging it up as a
  historical report or sending it only when a user is online and connected.

## 0.7.1

 - on_block and copy_statement edited to prevent nodes from being dependent 
   on root node and a non-root node.

## 0.7.0

- Add reference tile and device for testing the effects of update scripts.  The
  device is reference_1_0 and the controller tile is refcon_1.

## 0.6.4

- subtract_a_from_b Node now fixed to subtract_afromb

## 0.6.3

- Move SetDeviceTagRecord into iotile-core since it is used in iotile-build now.

## 0.6.2

- Fix dead_code_elimination to not get rid of trigger_streamer nodes.

## 0.6.1

- Fix regression in ascii and snippet output formats caused by changes in 0.6.0.

## 0.6.0

- Add support for directly creating binary device updating scripts from an sgf
  file. There is a new `-f script` output format supportd in `iotile-sgcompile`
- Add UpdateRecord objects for all major sensorgraph update actions so that
  iotile-updateinfo can decode and display nice data on sensorgraph updates.
- Add single function for compiling and optimizing a sensorgraph: compile_sgf.
  This is accessible at iotile.sg.compile_sgf.

## 0.5.1

- Add support for subtract statement.  This complete support for all currently
  supported embedded processing nodes.  You can current subtract a constant
  stream from any other stream.

## 0.5.0

- Add dead code elimination for nodes that produce no visible output.  This
  improvement is necessary for the introduction of additional user ticks since
  they will generate a lot of unnecessary nodes in case the user wants to use 
  them.
- Improve remove-copylatest optimization pass.  We can now optimize cases where
  the copy-latest is on a constant node with multiple other nodes writing to
  that constant node.
- Topologically sort nodes during compilation to avoid issues when node lists
  are programmed into an IOTile device.  (Issue #315)
- Add support for removing unnecessary constant values that may be present
  after optimization.
- Adds the ability to specify an app_tag/app_version in an SGF file and output
  the right programming commands as a snippet.

## 0.4.0

- Improve the optimization of counter nodes by better downgrading split counters
  from copy_all to copy_latest when it can be proven that readings will arrive
  one at a time. (Issue #317)
- Add ability to simulate sensorgraphs and create traces that can be compared
  to ensure that the behavior of a sensor graph doesn't change.  (Issue #318)
- Fix bug in remove_copylatest optimization pass that would produce incorrect
  results if a node with copy_all_a was connected to a node that had been
  removed.  (Issue #320)
- Adds support for defining external stimuli into the sensor graph simulator
  either via command line or programmatically.  (Issue #321)

## 0.3.3

- Add support for parsing binary node descriptors.  (Issue #311)
- Fix incorrect pluralization of buffered streams

## 0.3.2

- Add support for two new ascii output formats: ascii and config that are 
  compatible with programmatically loading sensor graphs into iotile devices.
- Add support for passing hex encoded binary values in set config statements.
  The syntax is to pass hex:AABBCC with the hex encoded bytes following the hex:
  prefix.  This is decoded automatically into a bytes object.

## 0.3.1

- Add support for specifying a second condition in an on block.  You can
  specify up to two named events or stream conditions with a combiner of either
  'and' or 'or'.

## 0.3.0

- Add support for generic when blocks that support clock gating on any stream
  condition
- Add support for copying a constant value, e.g. inside of on block.  The
  syntax is `copy number => output stream;`

## 0.2.2

- Add support for user only and combined streamer selectors based on new
  firmware support

## 0.2.1

- Add test coverage for negative config variables and arrays

## 0.2.0

- Add support for updated stream selectors that include combined selectors
  and selectors that include important system break information like reboots
  in user data streamers.

## 0.1.2

- Support negative numbers and arrays.

## 0.1.1

- Fix stream allocation when triggering on an input stream

## 0.1.0

- First alpha release for internal testing
- Supports compiling sensor graphs, basic optimzations on the underlying graph
  to fix the major inefficiencies added by the compiler and then exporting the
  sensor graph for running on a device or simulating on a computer
