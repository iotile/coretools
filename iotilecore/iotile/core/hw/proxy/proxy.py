    Manager Proxy for configuration variables on IOTiles

    Handles querying what config variables are defined, setting and getting
    their values.  Note that config variables should not change when application
    code is running so set_config_variables should not be called once an application
    is launched.

    Config variables should be thought of like environment variables in UNIX.  Each
    tile is conceptually a process and the config variables are the environment
    variables that are used to configure how that process runs.  They are captured
    when the process starts and should not change during process execution.

    Similarly, config variables are set on each tile by the TileBus controller every
    time the tile resets.  The tile can then read them to figure out how it should
    initialize itself.

    The variable cannot change value while the tile is running.  If you want to update
    a config variable, you need to stream that new value to the tile immediately after
    it resets before it passes control from its executive to its application firmware.

    This is usually not done manually but rather as part of the initialization process
    performed by the TileBus controller managing the IOTile Device.

    This ConfigManager is useful primarily for debugging, checking what values are actually
    set on a tile and what varibles it supports.
