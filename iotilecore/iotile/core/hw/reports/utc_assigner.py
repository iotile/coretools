"""Helper module for assigning UTC times to readings without a realtime clock.

Some IOTile devices timestamp their readings in uptime rather than UTC time,
which means a conversion process is needed to convert to absolute time from
the device's local reference time.

The UTCAssigner class provides a reference implementation of this conversion
process.  The conversion algorithm looks for known points in time where both
the device uptime and absolute UTC time are known.  These points are known as
anchors.  For any other reading, the difference in uptime between it and the
closest anchor is added to the absolute UTC time of the anchor to calculate
the absolute UTC time of the reading.

In the easy case, when there are no device resets between the reading you want
to convert and an anchor point and uptimes are known for each point, this
reconstruction process is exact.

However, in the general case, an exact assignment is not possible and
UTCAssigner uses various other methods to infer an appoximate UTC timestamp,
returning confidence metrics along with the assigned value.
