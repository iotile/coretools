class IOTileReading:
    """Base class for readings streamed from IOTile device.

    Each reading represents a single time/value pair sent from an IOTile Device.
    Since many IOTile Devices do not have a hardware realtime clock, the timestamp
    that is assigned to a reading may only be a relative interval from a fixed
    event in the past, like the time the device turned on.

    If the user knows the absolute time for this event they can pass it as a datetime
    in time_base to turn the relative reading timestamp into an absolute datetime
    accessible as reading_time.

        raw_time (int): the number of seconds since the device turned on
            when the reading was taken
        time_base (datetime): An optional estimate of when the device was
            last turned on so that we can calculate the actual time of the
            reading
        reading_time (datetime): An optional UTC time when this event was acquired.
            If combined with time_base, this value will take precedence and time_base
            and raw_time will be ignored.
