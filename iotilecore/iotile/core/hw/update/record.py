        this record matches and return a quality score between 0 and 100, with

        Many times, only a single record type will match a given binary record

        set_userkey both producing a call_rpc record with different RPC
        values.  The MatchQuality method is used to allow for rich decoding
        of such scripts back to the best possible record that created them.

            record_data (bytearay): The raw record that we should check for

            You should use the constants defined in MatchQuality as much as
            possible.  The only exception to the 0 to 100 rules is if you
            return MatchQuality.DeferMatch which means that we are matching a
