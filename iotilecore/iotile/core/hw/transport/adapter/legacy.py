class DeviceAdapter:
    """Classes that encapsulate access to IOTile devices over a particular communication channel

    Subclasses of DeviceAdapter implement concrete access channels over which IOTile devices
    can be controlled and send data. Examples area a bluetooth low energy communication channel
    or USB.  In order to fit into the rest of the IOTile tooling systems, only a few functions
    need to be implemented in a DeviceAdapter as shown below.  At its core, DeviceAdapters need
    to be able to connect/disconnect from a device, open/close an interface on the device, send RPCs
    and send scripts.

    The interface to a DeviceAdapter is:
    connect_async
    connect_sync

    disconnect_async
    disconnect_sync

    open_interface_async
    open_interface_sync

    close_interface_async
    close_interface_sync

    send_rpc_async
    send_rpc_sync

    send_script_async
    send_script_sync

    probe_async
    probe_sync

    debug_async
    debug_sync

    periodic_callback
    can_connect

    stop_sync

    Subclasses only need to override the '_async' versions of each call.  The synchronous versions will
    be automatically functional using the '_async' versions provided that the '_async' version not use
    multiprocessing to invoke its callback, i.e. it should use multithreading since the default synchronous
    adapter function needs a shared memory lock.

    periodic_callback should be a non-blocking callback that is invoked periodically to allow
    the DeviceAdapter to maintain its internal state.

    Additionally you can register callbacks that will be called in the following circumstances:

    on_disconnect: called when the device disconnects unexpectedly
        Signature of on_disconnect should be on_disconnect(adapter_id, connection_id)
    on_report: called when the device has streamed a complete sensor graph report
        Signature of on_report should be on_report(connection_id, report),
        where report is a subclass of IOTileReport.
    on_scan: called when this device is seen during a scan of this communication channel
        Signature of on_scan should be on_scan(adapter_id, device_info, expiration_interval)
    on_trace: called when the device has received tracing data, which is an unstructured string
        of bytes.  Signature of on_trace should be on_trace(connection_id, trace_data),
        where trace_data is a bytearray.
