    """Callback based adapter that gives access to one or more virtual devices

    The adapter is created and serves access to the virtual_devices that are
    found by name in the entry_point group iotile.virtual_device.

    There are two ways to passing configuration dictionaries down into a
    VirtualDevice attached to this VirtualDeviceAdapter.  Both are performed
    by encoding the port string with {{device_name}}@{{config_info}}.  You
    can either pass a path to a json file in {{config_info}} which is loaded
    as a dictionary or you can prepend a '#' to the front of config_info and
    pass a base64 encoded json string that is decoded into a dict.  Both are
    identically passed to the underlying __init__ function of the VirtualDevice

    If you choose to use a json file, the format must be::

        {
            "device":
            {
                ARGS GO HERE
            }
        }

    The required device key is to allow for this file to host information about
    multiple other kinds of iotile entities without collisions.

    If you are programmatically specifying the dictionary then it should just
    be a normal json with no parent "device" key such as:

        {
            ARGS GO HERE
        }

    Args:
        port (string): A port description that should be in the form of
            device_name1@<optional_config_json1;device_name2@optional_config_json2
        devices (list of VirtualIOTileDevice): Optional list of precreated virtual
            devices that you would like to add to this virtual adapter.  It can sometimes
            be easier to pass precreated devices rather than needing to specify how
            they should be created.
