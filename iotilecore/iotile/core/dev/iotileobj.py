    """Object representing an IOTile component that implements or extends CoreTools.

    IOTile components are "projects" in the sense of traditional IDEs,
    "packages" in nodejs or "distributions" in python.  They are single
    directories that contain related code and a metadata file that describes
    what the project is and how to use it.

    Since IOTile components describe building blocks for IOT devies, they do not
    contain code in a single language but could describe a variety of different
    kinds of artifacts such as:

    - firmware images
    - python extensions for CoreTools
    - build automation steps used in hardware manufacturing
    - emulators for specific IOTile devices

    The unifying concepts that extend to all of the above finds of components are
    that they product "artifacts" through a build process, the entire component
    has a single version and it can have dependencies on other components.

    There is a single file inside the root of the component directory,
    `module_settings.json` that contains all of this metadata.

    The `IOTile` object is constructed from a `module_settings.json` file and
    provides helper routines to parse and search its contents.
