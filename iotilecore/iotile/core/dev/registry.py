        This is the centralized way for all parts of CoreTools to allow plugin
        behavior.  Whenever a plugin is needed, this method should be called
        to load it.  Examples of plugins are proxy modules, emulated tiles,
        iotile-build autobuilders, etc.

        Each kind of plugin will typically be a subclass of a certain base class
        and can be provided one of three ways:

        1. It can be registered as an entry point in a pip installed package.
           The entry point group must map the group passed to load_extensions.
        2. It can be listed as a product of an IOTile component that is stored
           in this ComponentRegistry.  The relevant python file inside the
           component will be imported dynamically as needed.
        3. It can be programmatically registered by calling ``register_extension()``
           on this class with a string name and an object.  This is equivalent to
           exposing that same object as an entry point with the given name.

        There is special behavior of this function if class_filter is passed
        and the object returned by one of the above three methods is a python
        module. The module will be search for object definitions that match
        the defined class.

        The order of the returned objects list is only partially defined.
        Locally installed components are searched before pip installed
        packages with entry points.  The order of results within each group is
        not specified.

        Args:
            group (str): The extension type that you wish to enumerate.  This
                will be used as the entry_point group for searching pip
                installed packages.
            name_filter (str): Only return objects with the given name
            comp_filter (str): When searching through installed components
                (not entry_points), only search through components with the
                given name.
            class_filter (type or tuple of types): An object that will be passed to
                instanceof() to verify that all extension objects have the correct
                types.  If not passed, no checking will be done.
            product_name (str): If this extension can be provided by a registered
                local component, the name of the product that should be loaded.
            unique (bool): If True (default is False), there must be exactly one object
                found inside this extension that matches all of the other criteria.

        Returns:
            list of (str, object): A list of the found and loaded extension objects.

            The string returned with each extension is the name of the
            entry_point or the base name of the file in the component or the
            value provided by the call to register_extension depending on how
            the extension was found.

            If unique is True, then the list only contains a single entry and that
            entry will be directly returned.
