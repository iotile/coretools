    """A worker thread that handles queued work.

    This class takes a single callable as a parameter in __init__
    and starts a background thread with a shared queue.  Whenever
    an item is put in the shared queue, the callable is called with
    that work item.

    The return value of that callable is passed back to the caller
    or given via a callback function.

    The key methods of this class are:

    - dispatch(item, callback=None): Synchronously dispatches a work item to
      the queue and waits for the result.  If callback is not None, this
      function will return immediately and the result will be passed to the
      callback when it is ready.
    - stop(): Synchronously stop the background thread.  This will wait for
      all currently queued work items to finish and then cleanly shut down the
      background thread.
    - flush(): Wait until the work queue is momentarily empty().  This method
      is useful for ensuring that all work items received up until this method
      was called have been processed.

    Args:
        handler (callable): The handler function that will be passed all of the
            work items queued in dispatch() and should return a result that will
            be the return value of dispatch().  If this function throws an exception,
            it will be rethrown from dispatch.

    and call it in the future if it needs to.  The handler can inspect
    the callback by calling current_callback(), which will raise an
    exception if not called while an item is being dispatched.
