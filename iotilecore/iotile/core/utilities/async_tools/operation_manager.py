"""Message driven asynchronous state machines.

This module allows you to define a complex operation that blocks at certain
points to wait for one or more messages to be received.  There can be
many operations running in parallel and multiple operations can be triggered
by the same message.  Messages are just dictionaries and the matching can
be according to any keys in the messages.

The OperationManager class is designed to provide a friendly API on which to
build complex, asynchronous network or hardware operations.

The prototypical use case is dealing with messages received from bluetooth low
energy hardware. There is a single channel over which all messages are
received but they are logically multiplexed to multiple different parallel
connections.

In each of those connections you could have multiple parallel operations
happening (such as sending data to one characteristics while reading data from
another).  Each of those operations could be a multi-step non-atomic process
where the step transitions consist of waiting for the receipt of one or more
messages.

Implementing these operations usually involves complex callback or
multithreading based code.  OperationManager provides a tailored API for
allowing a coroutine to block until a specific message is received (or one of
several messages are received).

The goal is to allow the creation of simple coroutines that can safely share
access to to the underlying multiplexed channel and clearly specify what
messages they are waiting for to continue their operation.

    This utility class is designed to provide a friendly API on which to build
    complex, asynchronous network or hardware operations.  The prototypical
    use case is dealing with messages received from bluetooth low energy
    hardware.

    You pass it messages using the process_message() API, where a message can
    either be an object with properties or a dictionary.  Each message is then
    compared to see if anyone is waiting for that message and if so, the
    waiter is unblocked or a callback is called.

    The goal is to be able to write coroutines that cleanly block until a
    specific message is received or timeout safely.

    You can block on a message by calling OperationManager.wait_for() with a
    specification of the message you are looking for.  If you just want a
    callback every time a certain kind of message is received, use
    OperationManager.every_match().
