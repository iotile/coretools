"""Optional base class for all shared resources used in recipe steps.

A shared resource is something that should persist between single step
actions.  They are useful primarily for not repeating setup operations
that could be time consuming multiple times in a single recipe.

For example, you could setup a shared hardware_manager resource that
exits for the life of your recipe and call many steps that individually
use that hardware_manager to perform actions on an IOTile device.
